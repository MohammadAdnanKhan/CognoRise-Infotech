# This repository contains the tasks for my internship at CognoRise Infotech. 📚

It contsins three Jupyter notebooks for different tasks along with the Datasets used in each.
## First Task:-
### 🌻 Iris Flower Classification - This Project explores machine learning classification with the Iris flower dataset. It aims to build a SVM model that can predict the species (Iris versicolor, Iris setosa, or Iris virginica) of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. 

## Second Task:- 
### 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction - This Project explores the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 through the lens of machine learning. We'll delve into the passenger data, uncovering patterns and relationships between various factors like passenger class, gender, age, and travel arrangements, and their potential influence on survival rates. By building a Support Vector Machine (SVC) model, we aim to predict survival outcomes based on these features, gaining insights into the factors that may have played a role in this historical disaster.

## Third task :- 
### 🏎️ Car Price prediction - This Project delves into the world of car price prediction. We'll explore the factors that influence a car's value, from brand reputation and features to horsepower and mileage. By leveraging machine learning, we'll build a model that can predict a car's price based on its characteristics. This journey will involve data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, ultimately aiming to unveil the key features that drive car prices in the market.
